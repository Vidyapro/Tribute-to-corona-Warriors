					<p>
						Doctors,nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. In response to the global pandemic, the under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges. The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators. In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and ventilators as their weapons. Not to forget, medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the antidote to the disease. <br> Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty.

					<p>
						It is important to note that the risk to policemen is not just to those on-duty but also to their families, which include young children and aged parents.While these men in uniform selflessly choose to put their lives at risk, their families remain at home living their lives in doubt and fear. Many state police departments have arranged for personnel to stay in police training institutes and stations to limit their exposure to families, but not all personnel on duty can be accommodated in these facilities. In fact, many security personnel have chosen to maintain distance from their families even while at home and confine themselves to cordoned areas.

					<p>
						Cleanliness and hygiene never seemed to be of a greater concern before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since maintaining cleanliness, hygiene and disinfecting places are the only way to remain unaffected from the virus, the people making sure hospitals are free of germs be getting more of a voice.Even though several healthcare authorities have been spreading public awareness about the survival of this deadly virus on different surfaces, the fact that the mundane items and the spaces of our daily lives should be kept clean with more concern during the pandemic is often taken for granted. Despite this deadly time, people who are involved in cleaning and disinfecting hospitals or hospital-like settings are not being prioritised and acknowledged.

They bring us our groceries, medicine, and other essential goods at our doorstep. Ecommerce sites like Flipkart, eBay, Amazon, Big basket, Med-Life, and Grofers are working 24/7 to make the regular supply. Since lockdown had been announced there are many speculations about the shortage of food and medicine that were circulating which were making people panic. However, speculation is not true.

						The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the very roots of the education system. Till this global pandemic, we have been talking to our students, mentoring them and tutoring them using chalk and board in the class rooms. And suddenly we were awakened to a new normal when we were asked to connect to our students using means such as WhatsApp, virtual classes, online classes using platforms like Google, Zoom and Webex, and mobile applications etc. As warriors, we took to online teaching, shared notes, and sent assignments to our students. This transition from routine classroom teaching to online class was not very smooth. This sudden shift over to a completely online format had proved to be a real roller coaster ride. Teachers, being the nation builder and future enabler have to shoulder great responsibility.<a class="read-more" href="/trending-colors/">&raquo;</a>

						ASHA workers have identified themselves as Corona warriors by visiting homes of all those under quarantine and collecting vital statistics, that is very much useful in the fight against the deadly pandemic, which has caused havoc across the globe, claiming more than one lakh lives. Even as the people of the district are worried over the spread of the virus, ASHA workers have lent support to the District Administration in stopping the disease from hitting the community transmission stage.
